# Image Hashtag Gnerator AI Web APP

This AI Web App helps you to generate attractive and creative #Hashtag for your social media. This Web App uses the Hugging Face model API and OpenAI API to automatically generate hashtags for images


## Documentation

In this web app I used two pretrained model for generating caption for image, for showing result difference between two model for same image
* BLIP
* VIT

Form the captions of BLIP model and VIT model I generate more relatable caption using openAI
## BLIP Model
The BLIP model was proposed in **BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training** for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation by Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Caiming Xiong, Steven Hoi.

BLIP is a model that is able to perform various multi-modal tasks including

* Visual Question Answering
* Image-Text retrieval (Image-text matching)
* Image Captioning

## VIT

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model was proposed in An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale by Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, Jakob Uszkoreit, Neil Houlsby. Itâ€™s the first paper that successfully trains a Transformer encoder on ImageNet, attaining very good results compared to familiar convolutional architectures.
## Features

* Automatically generates #Hashtags for images based on their content
* Offers an intuitive user interface where anyone can upload an image and get AI-generated captions and tags
* Generates multiple captions that accurately describe the image
## Tech Stack

* Python for building web APP
* Streamlit for creating the user interface
* Hugging Face Pretrained model API for image caption generation
* OpenAI API for generating different relatable caption



## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or above
* Streamlit package
* Hugging Face API 
* OpenAI API credentials
* Other necessary Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
## Usage
* Install require Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
* streamlit run main.py this command in terminal
* Navigate to the URL provided after running the Streamlit run main.py
* Upload an image to the Web APP.
* Wait for the AI to generate captions
